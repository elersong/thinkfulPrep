            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>I'm a Junior Software Developer, hailing from southern Louisiana (the heartland of the Whodat Nation), but currently living in the land of the Great Salt Lake.</p>
            <p>As a code-centric southern gentleman, there are only three things that break my levees:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Warm, unsweetened tea</li>
               <li>Discovering a loop to be infinite at run-time</li>
               <li>Dallas Cowboys fans</li> <!-- I mean, right?! -->
            </ul>
            <p>Welcome to my homepage. <a href='mailto:grey.l.elerson@gmail.com'>Now, don't be a stranger!</a></p>

            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>I'm just a simple country hyper-chicken, looking to perfect my own secret blend of herbs and spices. I stumbled upon programming in college, and had some preliminary successes working as a freelancer before actually registering my own consultancy. I find that helping people to solve problems through software is as rewarding as it is stimulating-- and that's not a trait that's easy to find in today's job market.</p>
            <p>I've committed to the Thinkful Software Engineering program to sharpen the skills I have while building upon them. I'm excited to find out which topics I hadn't previously explored and to incorporate them into my personal and professional projects.</p>
            <!-- Sidenote: If you Thinkful judges have never played screeps, I love it for practicing new JS skills. Might be worth sharing with students.  -->
            <p>In my unfocused tinkering time, I enjoy playing <a href='https://screeps.com/'>SCREEPS</a>, caring for my rose garden and wrestling my dogs. I'm always looking to build partnerships for my SCREEPS colony.</p>
